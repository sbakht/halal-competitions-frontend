<h3>Competition motivation!</h3>


<h3>Quran [ 2 : 148 ] : So compete with one another in doing good</h3>

<p><b>FAQ</b> - How much time will it take? Signing up is super easy and quick! Once that is done, you can literally compete even for a total of a minute or two every week!</p>


<h3>A bit about the competitions!</h3>
<p>All members are asked to compete with anonymous usernames (for example; ‚ÄúHappy_ Muslim_92‚Äù ) so that there is no intention of showing off.</p>

<h3>Tasbih competition</h3>
<p>We have made an online Tasbih for you with some short but very powerful Adhkar.</p>

<h3>Mindful Minutes competition</h3>
There are three categories:
<ol>
  <li>Quran recitation (time in min)</li>
  <li>Quran - listening to Audio / reading translation (time in min)</li>
  <li>Time spent (in min) watching an Islamic video / lecture</li>
</ol>

<h3>Sadaqah (charity) competition</h3>
<p>This is also a weekly competition.</p>

<h3>Fitness competition</h3>
<p>Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) as saying:</p>
<figure>
<blockquote>
A strong believer is better and is more lovable to Allah than a weak believer, and there is good in everyone,--- [Sahih Muslim 2664]
</blockquote>
</figure>
This strength includes both physical strength and strength of faith.

<p>It is soundly narrated from the Prophet (PBUH) that he said:</p>
<figure>
<blockquote>
‚ÄúEverything in which there is no remembrance of Allah is idle play, except four things: a man playing with his wife; a man training his horse; a man running between two lines (as in a race); and a man learning how to swim.‚Äù
</blockquote>
<i>(Narrated by an-Nasaa‚Äôi in as-Sunan al-Kubra (8889); classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah (315).)</i>
</figure>

<p>As far as the weekly competition is concerned, there are several categories like pushups, jogging distance (km), sit-ups etc.</p>
